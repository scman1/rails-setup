Setting up a virtual machine 

Configure port forwarding for connecting from the host (local machine) 
to map a loopback port to the host broadcast address and port
eg:
host [127.0.0.1|or blank to use the assigned address for the host]:2522 guest [address can be blank]:22

1. Install openssh server on the vm guest and make sure it is running

$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server 
$ ps -A | grep sshd

2. create a key pair using:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "user@192.168.0.55"

3. Use ssh-copy-id to install SSH key on servers as authorized keys for passwordless 
authentication.

ssh-copy-id -i [id_file] [-p port] [user@]machine

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -p 2222 user@192.168.0.55 

4. test loging in to the server:

ssh -p 2222 user@192.168.0.55 

It should login without needing to enter password

5. Edit SSH config file to create a host alias to connect (~/.ssh/config). 

sudo nano ~/.ssh/config

The entry should look something like:

Host deployvm
    HostName 192.168.0.55
    Port 2222
    User abraham
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    IdentitiesOnly yes

At this point, the host alias can be used in the ansible hosts file  (inventory/hosts) 
and used when connecting to the host.
